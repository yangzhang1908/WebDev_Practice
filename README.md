## Project Highlights & Features

### Robust HTML Structure 
The foundation of this portfolio is built with a **clean and semantic HTML5 structure**. 
Each section, from the `header` and `nav` to dedicated `sections` for "About Me," "Projects," "Skills," and "Contact," is logically organized. This ensures excellent readability and maintainability, forming a solid base for both styling and functionality.

### Enhanced Accessibility 
Accessibility was a core consideration from the start. Key features include:
* **Descriptive `alt` attributes** for all images, particularly in the "Projects" section, ensuring screen readers convey visual information effectively.
* Use of **semantic HTML5 tags** (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, `<figure>`) that intrinsically improve accessibility and SEO.
* **`aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` attributes** are strategically used to provide more context for navigation and section headings, further aiding assistive technologies.
* Form elements (`<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`) are properly associated with their `<label>` tags for improved usability and accessibility.

### Comprehensive CSS Styling 
The website boasts a **modern and consistent visual style** applied comprehensively using CSS. This includes:
* Global resets for `font-family`, `margin`, `padding`, and `background-color` to establish a clean base.
* Styling for the `header` and `navigation` to create an intuitive and visually appealing menu.
* Structured layouts for each content `section`, including a **card-like grid for projects** using `display: flex`.
* Styling for lists (`ul`, `li`) in the "Skills" section for better presentation.
* A well-styled "Contact" form that ensures usability.

### Dynamic JavaScript Interactivity 
JavaScript is integrated to bring the website to life, offering a dynamic user experience:
* **Smooth scrolling** is implemented for all internal navigation links, providing a fluid transition between sections.
* A **mobile-friendly hamburger menu** toggles navigation visibility on smaller screens, enhancing usability on devices.
* Project images feature a **lightbox effect**, allowing users to view larger versions of project screenshots in a modal window.
* The "Contact Me" form includes **client-side validation** for name, email, and message fields, providing real-time feedback to users before submission.

### Full Responsiveness 
The website is designed with a **mobile-first approach** and is fully responsive across various screen sizes.
* **CSS Media Queries** are extensively used to adjust layouts, font sizes, and element positioning.
* A **breakpoint at 768px** specifically modifies the navigation to a mobile-friendly version, replacing the desktop menu with a hamburger icon.
* Images and videos are ensured to be responsive using `max-width: 100%` and `height: auto`, maintaining their aspect ratio and preventing overflow on smaller screens.
